The kernel is a string that composes an OpenCL (C-like) function

It must start with __kernel (double underscore)
It must have return type void
It usually takes at least one arguement

A few useful OpenCL functions:
  get_global_id(dim)	-> uniquely identifies work item in dimension dim in kernel
  get_local_id(dim)	-> uniquely identifies work item in dimension di in a work group

__global indicates that this is data in global scope


Note that it is important to have as many work group items in a work group as 
  possible, since they will share locally cached data
